# Metadata

Events are accompanied by a Metadata object that gives some context about the event.

> - id
> - timestamp (todo)
> - publishing module (todo)
> - forwarding information (todo. for events proxied from external systems) 

## Fields

- `id: UUID` &mdash; unique ID for the event.  
  > ID is currently generated by Core, upon publish. This might change in the future to handle external systems that generate their own events.
- ... &mdash; to be implemented


## Reading Event Metadata

Inside your [Module](modules.md), subscribe a `handler` method with a `metadata: Metadata` argument. The type-hint is optional.

For example:

```python
class MyAwesomeModule(BaseClass):

    def boot(self):
      self.subscribe(self.handle)

    def handle(self, event: BaseEvent, metadata: Metadata):
      print("Event id:", metadata.id)

```
